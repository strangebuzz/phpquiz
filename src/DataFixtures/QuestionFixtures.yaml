            As I am writing this quiz (2020-07-31), there is a slight difference between all versions and PHP 8.0.0alpha3:<br/>With this last version,
            the exception message "Foo\Bar" is wrapped by double quotes instead of single quotes for other versions (\'Foo\Bar\'). 🤔

            7.4 unpack a Traversable by keeping the iteration order, but it fails when the keys are strings, even if those strings are numeric.

            All PHP functions prefixed by "array_" expect an array, and not a traversable/iterator. The result is "[nothing]" (A).
            Note: If the values had been in an array it would have been "int(42)" because internal array functions do not follow strict typing.

            When you use the PHP function <code>array_merge</code>, all values in the input arrays with numeric keys will be renumbered

            The PHP class name resolution using ::class is a compile time transformation.
            As a consequence, class names are expanded even if the class does not exist. No error is issued in that case.
            The right answer was "A".

            You can use the same name for a class, a method, a function and a constant. In addition, functions and classes are case-insensitive.
            The right answer was "BAR" (C). "BARBAR" happens for versions prior to PHP 8 when there is no namespace.

            It is not necessary to specify type, but if you do, the first one must be a string and the second an array.

            PHP magic setters do not follow strict_types and you can set a property which does not exist.

            PHP variables in double-quoted strings are parse differently if they are between braces or not.
            Outside braces, PHP can access to properties but don't call methods.
            The right answer was '() / bar' because property 'bar' doesn't exists.

            Yes, PHP 8 always has alternative syntax for control structures, and you can mix them. "goto" was introduced in PHP 5.3
            and it still exists in version 8. This is not a good practice, please do not use it. This quiz is a joke! The right answer was "fooend" (B).

            PHP references on properties allow you to make a variable refer to the property's content.
            If the property is type hinted, the type will be checked. The right answer was "TypeError".

            #PHP namespaces, classes and functions/methods are not case sensitive, but properties and constants are.
            Since PHP 8, it is not possible to declare a case insensitive constant.

            it's string "312" The right answer was "TypeError".

            When iterate through a PHP object, all visible properties will be used.

            It is possible that two implemented interfaces use the same name, but the signatures must be identical.
            Since PHP 8, contravariance allows to widen the parameter type, so this code is allowed.
