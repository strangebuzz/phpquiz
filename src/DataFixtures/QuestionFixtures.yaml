            As I am writing this quiz (2020-07-31), there is a slight difference between all versions and PHP 8.0.0alpha3:<br/>With this last version,
            the exception message "Foo\Bar" is wrapped by double quotes instead of single quotes for other versions (\'Foo\Bar\'). 🤔

            7.4 unpack a Traversable by keeping the iteration order, but it fails when the keys are strings, even if those strings are numeric.

            PHP function <code>property_exists</code> will find the private property, but you cannot access to it.

        codeImageFile: 4.jpg
        answer_explanations: >
            All PHP functions prefixed by "array_" expect an array, and not a traversable/iterator. The result is "[nothing]" (A).
            Note: If the values had been in an array it would have been "int(42)" because internal array functions do not follow strict typing.

        answer_explanations: >
            When you use the PHP function <code>array_merge</code>, all values in the input arrays with numeric keys will be renumbered
            with incrementing keys starting from zero. The right answer was "42" (C).

        codeImageFile: 6.jpg
        answer_explanations: >
            The PHP class name resolution using ::class is a compile time transformation.
            As a consequence, class names are expanded even if the class does not exist. No error is issued in that case.
            The right answer was "A".

            You can use the same name for a class, a method, a function and a constant. In addition, functions and classes are case-insensitive.
            The right answer was "BAR" (C). "BARBAR" happens for versions prior to PHP 8 when there is no namespace.

            An abstract method cannot be private and this will raise a fatal error during compile time. The right answer was "B".

            PHP magic methods must be declared with the exact number of parameters.
            It is not necessary to specify type, but if you do, the first one must be a string and the second an array.

            Outside braces, PHP can access to properties but don't call methods.
